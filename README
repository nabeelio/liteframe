Liteframe PHP 5.3+ Framework
http://github.com/nshahzad/liteframe


I know, I know, there are a ton of frameworks out there. But I needed something
very lightweight, and figured it would be a nice and useful exercise in using some 
new features of PHP 5.3, particularly namespaces. This will stay really simple, 
emulating some of CakePHPs features. I'll be integrating Doctrine soon, but I 
don't really need database connectivity right now. I'm basically using this as
a lookup server, for relaying Amazon API requests to the front-end, and caching 
them in memcache/APC.

Usage:

I'll have more detailed docs, but look at the app/controllers/default_controller.php
Basically, that's it. I'll be adding more functions to the $this-> as I need them,
or ones that make sense.
