Liteframe PHP 5.3+ Framework
http://github.com/nshahzad/liteframe


I know, I know, there are a ton of frameworks out there. But I needed something
very lightweight, and figured it would be a nice and useful exercise in using some 
new features of PHP 5.3, particularly namespaces. This will stay really simple, 
emulating some of CakePHPs features. I'll be integrating Doctrine soon, but I 
don't really need database connectivity right now. I'm basically using this as
a lookup server, for relaying Amazon API requests to the front-end, and caching 
them in memcache/APC.

CakePHP is a bit 'heavy' for my purposes, but I do like their ideas and some of
their conventions. So I'm picking up their best habits and some of my habits I've
picked up from using other frameworks as well. Overall, I just want this to be
super light, with all the basics

--------------
Installation:
--------------

The easiest way to keep liteframe updated (since it's under heavy development) 
is to use it as a git repo:

First create your project:

	git clone https://nshahzad@github.com/nshahzad/liteframe.git project
	cd project
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

The last two lines download/update the doctrine library from its repository.
And then finally, to update:

	git pull
	git submodule update


--------------
Usage:
--------------

Point Apache (or whatever webserver) to the app/www directory.

I'll have more detailed docs, but look at the app/controllers/default_controller.php
Basically, that's it. I'll be adding more functions to the $this-> as I need them,
or ones that make sense.

Add your custom configuration options into app/config/config.php using:

	\Liteframe\Config::set('KEY', 'VALUE');

And retrieve using:

	\Liteframe\Config::get('KEY');

Default configuration options are located in:

	/liteframe/config/config.php


--------------
Application Controller:
--------------

As with CakePHP, there's a controller you can use as the parent which you can
modify to add custom stuff which is available to all controllers. The file is:

	liteframe/controllers/app_controller.php

The default controller inherits from this. To customize, copy into the app directory:

	app/app_controller.php

--------------
Layouts:
--------------

Under apps/layouts there's a default.tpl. This is the default layout used. You
can have multiple layouts, and change the one that's used by changing:

	$this->layout = 'default';

In the controller. All of your HTML will go there, just where content goes, place:

	<?php echo $content_for_layout; ?>

You can also get information about the current controller/function using:

	<?php print_r($run_info); ?>

$run_info is an Array containing:

	Array ( [controller] => lookup [function] => index [args] => Array ( ) ) 


--------------
To Do List:
--------------

These are some things which I'll end up adding as I use this:

	* Routing options/settings
	* Integrate Doctrine2
